// A WebSocket service handler must impliment the `WebSocketSessionHandler` protocol.
// This protocol requires the function `handleSession(request: WebRequest, socket: WebSocket)`.
// This function will be called once the WebSocket connection has been established,
// at which point it is safe to begin reading and writing messages.
//
// The initial `WebRequest` object which instigated the session is provided for reference.
// Messages are transmitted through the provided `WebSocket` object.
// Call `WebSocket.sendStringMessage` or `WebSocket.sendBinaryMessage` to send data to the client.
// Call `WebSocket.readStringMessage` or `WebSocket.readBinaryMessage` to read data from the client.
// By default, reading will block indefinitely until a message arrives or a network error occurs.
// A read timeout can be set with `WebSocket.readTimeoutSeconds`.
// When the session is over call `WebSocket.close()`.

            // This indicates to the receiver that there is more data to come in subsequent messages but that all the data is part of the same logical message.
